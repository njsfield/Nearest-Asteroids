## Synopsis

This app accesses NASA’s NeoWS API to retrieve nearest asteroids from earth based on today’s (or nearest days) data.

The app is built with the latest browsers in mind, using CSS transforms and animations to render visual representations of the asteroids (and Earth) on screen.

My Graphmaker library is used to compare the miss distance, velocity and diameter data of each asteroid and plot the data on screen respectively.
The entire site was built with the mobile first approach, and utilises dynamically changing inline styles.
