# Graphmaker

## Synopsis

A set of tools to retrieve JSON data, access nested properties and values, compare and manipulate data, and build DOM elements to display the data in interesting ways. 

## TDD 

The project is test driven, with QUnit at the heart of testing. Through TDD I aim to build tools that can be used against a broad set of data, with reliable results and good error handling.

## Goals

Implement DOM manipulation tools to build elements on the fly
